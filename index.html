	<h1>Scuba Diving in The Caribbean</h1>
	</div>
		<p>The Caribbean is considered by many to be the dive capital of the world. Attractions such as the Blue Hole in Belize, reefs in St. Thomas, and shipwrecks in the Florida Keys all contribute to this regions' exsquisite diving culture. </p>
	<div style="text-align:left"></div>
	<h3> The Blue Hole </h3>
	<p>
		The Blue Hole off the coast of Belize is one of the most fascinating dive sites in the entire world. The area's unique circular shape caused my a submarine sinkhole makes it stand out from above but what's below is what truly makes it magnificent. The hole itslef stretches to a depth of 410 feet and has ledges at 69 feet, 161 feet andd 299 feet.

	<h3> St. Thomas Reefs </h3>
	<p>
		St. Thomas, located in the eastern Caribbean, is surrounded by some of the region's most vibrant reefs. These exquisite reefs contain species such as spiny Caribbean lobster, blue tang and even spotted eagle rays. All of this combines to make for some very enticing diving locations. Areas such as Coki Beach are a favorite with locals and tourists alike. One particular draw of this location is that the reefs are actually right beyond the beach which makes it accessible without a boat. A local dive shop, <i>Coki Dive Center</i>, is happy to assist with anything that hungry divers will be needing.

	<h3> Florida Keys Shipwrecks </h3>
	<p>
		The Florida Keys are a Caribbean escape for those divers who may not be able to venture further down into the region. There are numerous dive spots from Key Largo all the way down to Key West. Some personal favorites of mine are located off the coast of Key Largo and Islamorada. Two hot spot shipwreck dives are the Spiegel Grove and the Eagle. The Spiegel Grove is reached from Key Largo and is a 510 foot former naval vessel that is home to fish such as the goliath grouper. Furthermore, the Eagle, which rests off the coast of Islamorada, is a 287 foot former freight vessel whose artificial reef makes not only for some great diving, but allows fish such as amberjacks to call it home.
